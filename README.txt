arrowgame is the original code written back in 2013(in high school)
arrowgame2 has the exact same functionality but with the coding style improved. Indents are placed, unnecessary whitespace removed, and variable/class names are changed to conform to standard Java style rules. The code here is cleaner and more readable.
Important files to Note (filenames are based off of arrowgame2 folder):
 -ArrowBoard.java
     - This is the main portion of the game, which controls most of the functionality, from drawing the various 
       graphics to calculating collision detection.
 -Ammo.java
     - This file is the class of the ammo used in the game. Ammo.java uses the physics kinematics equations to 
       model the arrow's position and rotation angle throughout the game.
  -HuntingGameMain.java
     - Where the game actually runs.
